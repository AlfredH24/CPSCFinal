        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a first generation college student pursing a Bachelor's degree
            in Computer Science at California State University Fullerton. This 
            is currently my third year and I am grateful to have the 
            opportunity to learn so much. When I started my courses, I knew 
            almost nothing about coding. After three years, I have more than a 
            few programming languages including C++, Python, R, and a few more. 
            If you want to see a more complete list of the programs I have used 
            make sure to check out my skills page. Using the skills I have 
            picked up, I am putting my focus into game development. I am 
            currently learning modeling and animation skills so I can use them 
            in games. A long term goal of mine is to master all these skills so 
            I am able to create a game solo. I do plan on working in groups to 
            create larger games, but the idea of having an idea that is 
            uniquely mine and turning it into reality is appealing to me. 
            Outside of the Computer Science field, I enjoy music, reading, 
            movies, and screenprinting. I am now the vice president of the 
            comic book club at CSUF. Screenprinting alows me to do something 
            similar to coding, create something that you don't see everywhere. 
            I think about anything that I am interested in and ask myself, what 
            can I contribute to this?
