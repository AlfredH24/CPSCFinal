        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This game was my first attempt at any non-terminal focused game. 
            This was also my first time using Pygame and gave me a grasp on 
            drawing items to the screen. The game draws two images and asks you
            to pick the higher/lower scored movie. After the user makes a 
            decision the scores are revealed. There is also a score kept in the
            top left.

        <p>
            This being the first project I created using pygame, the concept 
            of loading and drawing to the window took some time to understand. 
            I also had to manage the rectangles for the correct and incorrect 
            anwers along with drawing the images of the movie.

            This project helped me understand concepts that I used later in 
            projects such as Alien Invasion. Without this groundwork, Alien 
            Invasion would have been much more difficult. This taught me how 
            even when a project can seem so minuscule, it can be used a step 
            into later projects.
