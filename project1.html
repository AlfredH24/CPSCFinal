        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Crossy Chicken is an endless runner game that has the user play as a
            chicken crossing multiple types of lanes (grass, highway, railroads, 
            and rivers). Each lane is filled with their own unique vehicle (cars, 
            trains, and logs). The player navigates through these lanes 
            collecting coins and trying to get as far as they can.

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Unreal Engine: used to build and run the game</li>
            <li>Blender: creating, importing, texturing, rigging, animating, and modifying models/assets</li>
            <li>MagicaVoxel: designing and painting assets</li>
            <li>Audacity: used to record and capture sounds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>This was my first Unreal Engine project and although I am proficient
            in C++ I had to learn how to use blueprints. I also had to 
            understand all the different classes and how to use them. Core 
            concepts to game development such as animation, rigging, game logic, 
            and GUI were emphasized on with this project. For example, creating 
            different blueprints for lanes, lane spawners, the player, vehicles, 
            items took a great effort to understand. Creating the game logic already 
            is difficult and trying to convert those ideas into Unreal Engine using 
            nodes and blueprints allowed me to gain a greater understanding of Unreal 
            Engine.</p>

        <p>
            From this project, it gave me many ideas for future games that I 
            could create through unreal engine. It also strengthened my 
            understanding of Unreal Engine and gave me the chance to create 
            something using the industry standard.
