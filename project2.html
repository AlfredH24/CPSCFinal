        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Alien Invasion is a 2D, arcade style, shooter game. The player has 3 
            lives and goes through levels with each one increasing in difficulty. 
            When the player loses all their lives a game over screen is presenting 
            the high scores which carry over after closing the game.

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pygame: used to build and run the game</li>
            <li>Piskel: creating, animating, and modifying sprites</li>
            <li>Audacity: used to record and capture sounds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>A small challenge I faced was creating the classes for aliens and 
            the logic behind them. There is an alien class which handles 
            individual aliens and a fleet class which handles all the aliens. 
            Drawing and updating the aliens also took more code than expected 
            to handle their movement, shooting, and reseting. The largest 
            challenge faced during this project was learning how to animate 
            sprite movement and explosions for aliens. When an alien is 
            destroyed an explosion animation is played and playing this
            animation with a timer while still being active in the game was 
            difficult through pygame. After creating an animation file which 
            handles the timer for frames using in game time, animations became easy.

            This project strengthing my understanding of collisions, actions, 
            animations, and high scores using pygame. This gives me the ability 
            to develop 2D games using pygame since programs such as Unreal 
            Engine only support 3D development.
